## Background
The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in analyzing Packet Capture (PCAP) files can significantly enhance the debugging process in Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN). LLMs can process vast amounts of network data, identify patterns, and detect anomalies that may indicate underlying issues. By leveraging natural language processing capabilities, LLMs can also provide detailed explanations and recommendations for resolving detected problems, making the debugging process more efficient and effective. This approach helps in maintaining the performance and reliability of O-RAN systems.

## Objectives
The primary goals of this topic are:

1. **Understand LLMs in PCAP Analysis**: Gain a comprehensive understanding of how Large Language Models can be utilized to analyze Packet Capture files.
2. **Identify Patterns and Anomalies**: Learn to identify patterns and detect anomalies in network data using LLMs.
3. **Enhance Debugging Processes**: Explore how LLMs can enhance the debugging process in Open Radio Access Networks by providing detailed explanations and recommendations.
4. **Improve O-RAN Performance**: Understand the role of LLMs in maintaining the performance and reliability of O-RAN systems.
5. **Practical Application**: Apply the knowledge gained to real-world scenarios and improve network analysis and debugging practices.

By achieving these goals, participants will be better equipped to leverage LLMs for efficient and effective PCAP analysis in O-RAN environments.
