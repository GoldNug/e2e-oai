# 1. Components

## 1.1 Common SMO/RIC Platform
Task: Build the SMO & RIC platforms from O-RAN Software Community (OSC)

## 1.2 Integrate the OSC SMO/RIC with Aruba Networks

## 1.3 Integrate the OSC SMO/RIC with ns3
**Tasks**: 

Use big data to enhance the modelâ€™s accuracy in ns3
- Wireless channel model: 
  - RSSI and SNR logs from STAs across different locations; 
  - channel state information (CSI), 
  - interference data, 
  - environmental contexts such as time of day, 
  - weather conditions, 
  - and building layouts.
- Usage pattern model: 
  - traffic volume, 
  - session duration of users stay connected to specific APs, 
  - peak and off-peak trends in different scales.
- User mobility model: 
  - STA handover logs, 
  - signal strength trajectories, 
  - connection history

# 2. Use Cases

# 2.1 Energy Saving

# 2.2 Rogue AP Localization

# 2.3 User Mobility Localization
