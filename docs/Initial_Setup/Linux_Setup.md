# Setting Up Linux on a Windows Device

There are multiple ways to setup the Linux OS. One relatively simpler, and more storage friendly method is by using a virtual machine.

First, we download an open source virtualization platform, [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)

We also ensure that we have the .iso files for the desired [OS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

After setting up through the virtual machine, allocate resources as necessary, but keep in mind the recommended storage and memory size for performing an RTT.
A successfully added and set-up machine will display [this output](). Power on the machine, and let updates install automatically.
